[# Jerrys-Simple-Calculator
A very simple Python calculator that's probably been made a million times already.
I don't like holding the shift key when using calculators, and instead of looking into a calculator
that doesn't make me I thought it would be more interesting to see if I could figure out making one myself.
The calculator only does arithmetic.
